<!-- Requirement is all authenticated route should have their own layout & it should 
    have heading that contain text welcome user  -->

<h2>Authentication Layout that can be accessible in login and register pages</h2>
<h3>Welcome User</h3>
<slot/>

<!-- But here problem come in URL auth had to be written to get out of it 
    ! Group routing (routeFolderName) 
    had to be created then directly login and register can be accessible 
-->
